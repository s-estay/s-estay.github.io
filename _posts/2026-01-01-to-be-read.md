This year, my goal is to read two books every month - a mix of re-reads, penpal recommendations, unread gems from my bookshelf, sci-fi classics, Hugo and Nebula winners, non-fiction, and works in multiple languages. I’m intentionally shifting away from a US-centric focus to include more European and voices. All books are in physical or audiobook format (no e-readers here!), sourced from my local library, my own collection, or new purchases. I crafted this list inspired by Youtuber As Told by Joey’s annual TBR (To Be Read) tracking list approach. Each month’s books share complementary themes or emotional tones, creating a cohesive reading journey.
