In 1897, three men embarked on a daring polar expedition, aiming to reach the unexplored North Pole by hydrogen balloon. Their plan was to fly over the pole and land safely in Russia or Canada. Instead, they vanished without a trace—until 30 years later, when their remains were discovered by whale hunters on the remote island of Vitön.

So much went wrong, and even now, no one has been able to fully explain what happened. Why did they die after surviving three months adrift on the ice, only three days after reaching Vitön, a place they believed would be their refuge for the winter before continuing south to safety?

Bea Uusma’s Vitön is nothing short of obsessive brilliance. She leaves no stone unturned in her relentless search for answers, and her passion for this century-old mystery is infectious. The book transforms what might seem like an obscure historical footnote into a gripping, urgent quest. Layer by layer, Uusma peels back the mystery, revealing new discoveries as if we’re right there with her. I found myself rooting for her, desperate for her to find the closure she’s pursued for years.

What makes Vitön so compelling is how deeply it draws you in. Uusma’s writing makes you laugh, makes you cry, and, above all, makes you care. By the end, you’re as invested in solving the puzzle as she is. I felt like I was in that little boat off the coast of Vitön, scanning the horizon for a signal, ready to pull on a dry suit and join the search. That’s the power of Uusma’s storytelling—it doesn’t just inform, it inspires.

Final rating: Four annoying polar bears out of five.
