There is a haunting effect about this book that follows you after you have put it down. Cormac builds a dreadful world that inevitably ask the questions: What if this actually happens? How far I am willing to go to survive? To protect the ones I love?

I like the no-bullshit rawness of the conversations between the father and the son. They respect and care deeply for each other. They tell the truth, even in the most difficult moments.

This book got scared and didn't want to finish it, but it is so beautifully written that it was very hard to just let go. I'm looking forward to pick up more books from McCarthy.

I know there is a movie with Viggo Mortensen out there. I think I will wait for a while to watch it. In my mind everything is very dark and in greyscale. The body of the man gets more and more destroyed after every chapter. His eyes are kind and very focused on the task at hand. The boy is very thin and the light of the world that is left. All the places the visited along the way got me scared and the people they met even more. How is the movie going to get all that right? Maybe it does, will see.
