Spoiler alert: Christopher’s father murdered Wellington the dog. Case closed.

From the very beginning, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time immerses us in the world of Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old boy with autism. The story unfolds through Christopher’s unique perspective, revealing how everyday experiences - often taken for granted by neurotypical people - can be overwhelming, confusing, or even physically distressing for someone on the spectrum. Haddon excels at portraying Christopher’s inner world, where logic is not dictated by social norms but by his own meticulously constructed rules. As Christopher explains, his way of making sense of life is just as valid as anyone else’s; after all, society’s “common logic” is merely an agreed-upon fiction, often just as arbitrary as his own.

Christopher lives with his divorced father, who works tirelessly to adapt - from the food they eat to the way they express affection - to ensure Christopher feels safe and understood. This dynamic raises a poignant question: What must it be like to parent a child like Christopher? The constant negotiation between love, patience, and frustration is palpable, and Haddon doesn’t shy away from the complexities of their relationship.

One of the book’s greatest strengths is its ability to make the reader see the world through Christopher’s eyes. His love for maths, puzzles, lists, and order resonates deeply, especially with those of us who also find comfort in structure and predictability. Like Christopher, I share an aversion to sudden changes, loud noises, and certain words or numbers. It left me wondering: Where do I fall on the spectrum? The book doesn’t provide answers, but it fosters empathy and self-reflection, which is perhaps even more valuable.

While some sections drag, the overall experience is engaging and thought-provoking. Haddon’s narrative style - direct, honest, and unfiltered - makes for a compelling listen, especially in audiobook form, where Christopher’s voice feels immediate and authentic.

Final rating: Three pet rats out of five.
