title: A Certain Hunger by Chelsea G. Summers (2020)

I picked up A Certain Hunger after stumbling across a review by As Told by Joey back in November 2025. Her take - “I read this book because I like books about food and food critics. She’s a psychopath, which I also like. Eating people didn’t bother me so much as all the weird sex stuff. Cannibals are fine, perverts not so much” - resonated with me. As someone who enjoys food-centric films and Hannibal (Mads Mikkelsen’s performance is a masterclass in chilling charm), I was intrigued. The premise of a food-obsessed, morally bankrupt protagonist? Sign me up.

But here’s the thing: I’ve taken to calling this book the “foodie psycho memoir,” and I can’t bring myself to recommend it, despite its undeniably intriguing setup.
From the first page, it’s painfully clear how hard Chelsea Summers is trying to make Dorothy Daniels sound clever. The prose is like an over-seasoned dish - too many metaphors, too many forced witticisms, and a rhythm that stumbles rather than flows. This should be a book you devour in a weekend, chuckling occasionally, then promptly forget. Instead, I found myself rereading paragraphs just to grasp the point, which is never a good sign. Maybe Dorothy Daniels is too smart for her own good, or maybe the writing is just trying too hard.

To fully appreciate A Certain Hunger, you need a working knowledge of 1990s American pop culture and a fondness for Sex and the City. Since I lack both, much of the book felt alienating. Names like Gael Greene, Bella Abzug, Sam Sifton, Ruth Reichl, and Paula Deen were dropped as if they were household staples, I mean, who are those people? At least I caught the Levi’s 501 reference - “I saw that snap-shimmy and imagined the furrow of his spine, the downy trail of hairs snaking below the waistband of his 501s” - so not all was lost.

The book’s structure is equally baffling. It reads like a series of Playboy articles strung together, each chapter as forgettable as the last. The setting - New York and Italy - feels tired, the taboo themes (cannibalism, infidelity, and a dash of nihilism) more like a checklist than a cohesive narrative. It’s as if someone said, “Let’s throw in every shocking topic we can think of, set it in two clichéd locations, and call it a memoir.”

Final Rating: This is a DNF for me, ten chapters were enough, one wasted minute of my life out of five. The book will stay on my shelf, but only as kindling for the fireplace.
